### Add a divider between columns on MSDN for clickable resizing for easier viewing on smaller screens

Do you want to split your screen between documentation and source-code but too much of MSDN's real estate is dedicated to navigation?  Do you find yourself wishing you could slide the navigation bar out of the way so that you can focus on content?

MSDN Resize is a simple extension that allows the user to reduce the size of the side navigation bar and return it to normal with a click of the mouse.

### HOW DOES IT WORK?

By adding a divider bar between the sidebar and the primary content of the page, all you have to do is click on the divider and instantly your content goes from 66% to 85% of the window. Click again to restore the original dimensions.

### Gettings Started
- [**Download From Chrome**](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/msdn-resize/bdcaffgeeafpmnpeogoipgfhklbppjlc) To test the extension, first install it on your chrome browser. After installing, you should see a new ![MSDN Resize Icon](MSDNResize16.png?raw=true) icon in your chrome navigation bar that is colored when on an MSDN website.
